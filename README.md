JsonPowerDB is powerfull,server-less,simple to use and multi-mode database.It means we can access different functionality of databases like Mongo-DB,Nosql,Mysql,etc at one place.In this project i have used all CRUD operation(Insert,Update,Delete) with HTML5/Jvascript using NetBeans.

It creates one webpage having form which input employees basic inforrmation,update employee information and also delete particular record by record number;Then It stores all data in JPDB in repective entered DB and relation.
